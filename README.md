# Score Board

Based on a Scrimba solo project
[Basketball Scoreboard](https://scrimba.com/frontend-path-c0j/~05h).

It was a learning experience to create the seven-segment font. I know the font already exists, but I wanted to learn how to make icon fonts. Gemini pointed me to [icomoon.io](https://icomoon.io/), which while not perfect, did the job for free.

Note that the method of adding button listeners made it much easier to change from basketball to quidditch: I only had to change the HTML. [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).
